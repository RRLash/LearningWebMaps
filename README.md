#Learning Web Maps
This is an agglomeration of resources I have found while I try to educate myself about web mapping technolgoy.

##Books
*[Web Cartography: Map Design for Interactive and Mobile Devices](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Cartography-Design-Interactive-Devices/dp/1439876223), by Ian Muehlenhaus

##Articles

##Software
*[Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/#darwin): time to learn about styling vector tiles with CartoCSS for the best looking online maps ever using this desktop software.  
*[Tilemill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/introduction/): Tilemill is no longer in development by Mapbox, having been replaced by Mapbox Studio, but it also used CartoCSS to style tiled web maps. It is worth knowing about though because Tilemill is still downloadable and  there are still a lot of example applications and tutorials around on the web for us beginners to work from.  
*CartoDB  
*ArcGIS Online  
*[CODEPEN](https:codepen.io) is a "playground for the front end side of the web." It is a web application that allows you to write/paste/edit HTML, CSS, and Javascript code that you might use to power an interactive web map.  It's real strength is the ability to share this code with others to enable more direct collaboration.


##Tutorials  
*[w3schools.com Google Maps API Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/googleapi/default.asp)
This tutorial is a nice introduction to the Google Maps API, and the website has a WSIWYG interface where you can explore the HTML code on your own  
*[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is the way I am learning the basics of HTML and CSS. This website hosts training modules on a variety of coding languages which are used to power websites today.  The tutorials are interactive, easy to follow, and free, and have helped me to no longer be afraid of looking at source code.  I like to keep CodePen open at the same time as a Codecademy tutorial so I can explore the concepts I am learning using my own data and use-cases.

##Tasks
*[Finding Bounding Box parameters](/GetBoundingBox.md)
